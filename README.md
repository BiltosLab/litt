# What is Litt
Litt is an educational attempt to develop a Version Control System (VCS) similar to Git. The primary goal is to provide a simplified understanding of how VCS works while maintaining a minimal codebase for clarity.

# Features/Goals:
1. Initialize a Repository: Create and initialize an empty repository to start tracking changes.
2. Staging Area: Allow users to stage changes for the next commit.
3. Commit Changes: Save the staged changes to the repository.
4. Branching and Merging: Support branch creation, tags, and branch merging.
5. Display Diffs: Show differences between the current files and the last commit.
6. Code Simplicity: Ensure the project remains under 2500 lines of code.
